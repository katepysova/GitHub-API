# GitHub API Project

This project uses [The GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en) - the APIs that you can use to interact with GitHub.

The main idea of this project is to get GitHub issues distributed into 3 categoties:

- ToDo (all new issues).
- In Progress (opened issues with assignee).
- Done (closed issues).

User is able to drag-n-drop between the columns and change the order of issues.

The final position will be saved in the localStorage with the expiration time of **15 minutes** (the value can be changed by updating `const ISSUES_EXP_TIME = new value`).

See [Project Demo](https://katepysova.github.io/GitHub-API/) serviced on GitHub Pages.
